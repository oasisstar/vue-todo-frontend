# Vue Todo Front-end 

This is the result of all the code that was written in the series of videos that i made, This is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpAQZ7HbweA&list=PLqhuffi3fiMNRoRU2dijolTTKOnE_197R) to the playlist and Unfortunately the repository is not separated into commits (every single does not equal a commit), this is the final repository for all the code that was written, only future videos will be added as commits.
